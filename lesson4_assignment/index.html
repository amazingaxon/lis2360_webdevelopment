            <h1> Gospel Global </h1>
                 <h2> The mission of <i>all</i> believers. </h2> 
                     <p> If you are on this website right now, I truly believe that God is doing something <strong>radical</strong> in your life. If you are unfamiliar with what is meant by the words 'Gospel Global' in the header, go check out the 'Gospel' tag at the top.</p>
                     <p>Gospel Global exists to inform the church and believers around the world on the importance of missions. We must be aware of which groups need to be reached, and different ways that we can become a part of Gods mission in 2019. It is going to take courage, trust, and faith, but with the help of the Holy Spirit and other believers, we will see the gospel go global and reach the ends of the earth with its saving message!</p>
                     <p>According to the Joshua Project, there are over 17,000 people groups in the world today. Of those 17,000 people groups, 7,063 of them are unreached, thus leading to them being known as 'unreached people groups'. The way a people group is defined is "the largest group within which the Gospel can spread as a church planting movement without encountering barriers of understanding or acceptance". This is outrageous and should instill the urge to <strong>GO</strong>, in the hearts of all believers around the world, but especially American Evangelicals.</p>
                     <p>The IMB (International Mission Board), as of 1/29/19 has 3,685 missionaries abroad in foreign countries, taking the message of Jesus to the rest of the world. The National Census shows that of all 325.7 million americans, 58 million identify with Evangelical Christianity. This is a daunting realization. That the largest overseas missionary organization in the world has 3,685 missionaries in the field from a larger population of 58 MILLION. This is a heartbreaking and startling statistic. As christians, this should challenge, convict, and convince you that you need to consider going global with the gospel. </p>
             
             <q> <strong>We are settling for a Christianity that revolves around catering to ourselves when the central message of Christianity is actually about abandoning ourselves.</strong> </q>
